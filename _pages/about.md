I am a graduate student in the department of Physics and Astronomy at Stony Brook University. I am an observational cosmologist. Broadly speaking, my research interest is understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy with all kinds of observational data. Currently, my research focuses on time delay cosmography, which measures the distances in the Universe and the present-day value of the Hubble constant H0 with strong lensing events.
