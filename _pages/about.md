About me
======

I am a graduate student in the department of Physics and Astronomy at Stony Brook University. I am an observational cosmologist. Broadly speaking, my research interest is understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy with all kinds of observational data. Currently, my research focuses on time-delay cosmography (TDC), which measures the absolute distances in the Universe and the present-day value of the Hubble constant H0 with strongly lensed transients (quasar, SNe, etc).

Current project
------

Me and my supervisor Simon Birrer are looking into the intrinsic shape of strong lensing galaxies and the systematic bias in TDC caused by the intrinsic shape distribution.
